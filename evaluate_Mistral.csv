30,"Grow your own lentils! Lentils are an easy crop for kids to grow, and can be harvested in just 8-10 weeks. It doesn't take much room and can be started indoors or outdoors. You will need to plant the seeds 2 inches deep and at least 4 inches apart. The lentil pods are 3 inches long and the lentils inside each pod are about half an inch in size. Lentils grow best when it is warm but they don't like a lot of sun.

This is a recipe from the ""Southern Living Annual Recipes"" cookbook that is just delicious. I love making this during the wintertime. It makes a very large amount, so be sure to plan ahead and use a big pot! This one will feed an army! You can make it in the slow cooker or on the stove top.

This recipe is for cooking lentils without any seasonings or anything added except water.
Cook in a pot with enough water to cover at least 3 inches above the lentils. Cook until tender and serve hot.
